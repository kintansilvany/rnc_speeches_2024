Thank
you
very
much.
Thank
you
very,
very
much.
Wow.
And
thank
you
Dana.
Thank
you
Kid
Rock,
sometimes
referred
to
as
Bob.
And
Thank
you
Lee.
Right
from
the
beginning.
Thank
you
very
much.
What
a
talent.
What
a
beautiful,
beautiful
song.
Friends,
delegates
and
fellow
citizens,
I
stand
before
you
this
evening
with
a
message
of
confidence,
strength
and
hope.
Four
months
from
now
we
will
have
an
incredible
victory
and
we
will
begin
the
four
greatest
years
in
the
history
of
our
country.
Together
we
will
launch
a
new
era
of
safety,
prosperity
and
freedom
for
citizens
of
every
race,
religion,
color
and
creed.
The
discord
and
division
in
our
society
must
be
healed.
We
must
heal
it
quickly.
As
Americans
we
are
bound
together
by
a
single
fate
and
a
shared
destiny.
We
rise
together
or
we
fall
apart.
I
am
running
to
be
president
for
all
of
America,
not
half
of
America,
because
there
is
no
victory
in
winning
for
half
of
America.
So
tonight,
with
faith
and
devotion,
I
proudly
accept
your
nomination
for
president
of
the
United
States.
Thank
you.
Thank
you
very
much.
Thank
you
very
much.
And
we
will
do
it
right.
We
will
do
it
right.
Let
me
begin
this
evening
by
expressing
my
gratitude
to
the
American
people
for
your
outpouring
of
love
and
support
following
the
assassination
attempt
at
my
rally
on
Saturday.
As
you
already
know,
the
assassin's
bullet
came
within
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
taking
my
life.
So
many
people
have
asked
me,
"What
happened?
Tell
us
what
happened,
please."
And
therefore,
I
will
tell
you
exactly
what
happened,
and
you'll
never
hear
it
from
me
a
second
time
because
it's
actually
too
painful
to
tell.
It
was
a
warm
beautiful
day
in
the
early
evening
in
Butler
Township
in
the
great
Commonwealth
of
Pennsylvania.
Music
was
loudly
playing
and
the
campaign
was
doing
really
well.
I
went
to
the
stage
and
the
crowd
was
cheering
wildly.
Everybody
was
happy.
I
began
speaking
very
strongly,
powerfully
and
happily
because
I
was
discussing
the
great
job
my
administration
did
on
immigration
at
the
southern
border.
We
were
very
proud
of
it.
Behind
me,
and
to
the
right,
was
a
large
screen
that
was
displaying
a
chart
of
border
crossings
under
my
leadership.
The
numbers
were
absolutely
amazing.
In
order
to
see
the
chart,
I
started
to,
like
this,
turn
to
my
right
and
was
ready
to
begin
a
little
bit
further
turn,
which
I'm
very
lucky
I
didn't
do,
when
I
heard
a
loud
whizzing
sound
and
felt
something
hit
me
really,
really
hard
on
my
right
ear.
I
said
to
myself
"Wow
what
was
that?"
It
can
only
be
a
bullet
and
moved
my
right
hand
to
my
ear
brought
it
down.
My
hand
was
covered
with
blood.
Just
absolutely
blood
all
over
the
place.
I
immediately
knew
it
was
very
serious,
that
we
were
under
attack
and
in
one
movement
proceeded
to
drop
to
the
ground.
Bullets
were
continuing
to
fly
as
very
brave
Secret
Service
agents
rushed
to
the
stage
and
they
really
did.
They
rushed
to
the
stage.
These
are
great
people
at
great
risk,
I
will
tell
you,
and
pounced
on
top
of
me
so
that
I
would
be
protected.
There
was
blood
pouring
everywhere
and
yet
in
a
certain
way
I
felt
very
safe
because
I
had
God
on
my
side.
I
felt
that.
The
amazing
thing
is
that
prior
to
the
shot
if
I
had
not
moved
my
head
at
that
very
last
instant,
the
assassin's
bullet
would
have
perfectly
hit
its
mark
and
I
would
not
be
here
tonight.
We
would
not
be
together.
The
most
incredible
aspect
of
what
took
place
on
that
terrible
evening
in
the
fading
Sun
was
actually
seen
later.
In
almost
all
cases,
as
you
probably
know,
and
when
even
a
single
bullet
is
fired,
just
a
single
bullet,
and
we
had
many
bullets
that
were
being
fired.
Crowds
run
for
the
exits
or
stampede,
but
not
in
this
case.
It's
very
unusual.
This
massive
crowd
of
10s
of
1000s
of
people
stood
by
and
didn't
move
an
inch.
In
fact
many
of
them
bravely
but
automatically
stood
up
looking
for
where
the
sniper
would
be.
They
knew
immediately
it
was
a
sniper.
Page 3
And
then
began
pointing
at
him.
You
can
see
that
if
you
look
at
the
group
behind
me
that
was
just
a
small
group
compared
to
what
was
in
front.
Nobody
ran
and
by
not
stampeding
many
lives
were
saved.
But
that
isn't
the
reason
that
they
didn't
move.
The
reason
is
that
they
knew
I
was
in
very
serious
trouble.
They
saw
it.
They
saw
me
go
down.
They
saw
the
blood
and
thought
actually
most
did
that
I
was
dead.
They
knew
it
was
a
shot
to
the
head.
They
saw
the
blood.
And
there's
an
interesting
statistic,
the
ears
are
the
bloodiest
part.
If
something
happens
with
the
ears,
they
bleed
more
than
any
other
part
of
the
body.
For
whatever
reason,
the
doctors
told
me
that.
I
said,
“Why
is
there
so
much
blood?”
He
said,
“it's
the
ears.
They
bleed
more.”
So
we
learned
something,
but
they
just,
they
just
this
beautiful
crowd
they
didn’t
want
to
leave
me.
They
knew
I
was
in
trouble.
They
didn't
want
to
leave
me
and
you
can
see
that
love
written
all
over
their
faces.
Incredible
people.
They’re
incredible
people.
Bullets
were
flying
over
us,
yet
I
felt
serene.
But
now
the
Secret
Service
agents
were
putting
themselves
in
peril.
They
were
in
very
dangerous
territory.
Bullets
were
flying
right
over
them,
missing
them
by
a
very
small
amount
of
inches.
And
then
it
all
stopped.
Our
Secret
Service
sniper
from
a
much
greater
distance
and
with
only
one
bullet
used
took
the
assassin's
life.
Took
him
out.
[CROWD:
Yes,
you
are!
Yes,
you
are!
Yes,
you
are!]
I'm
not
supposed
to
be
here
tonight.
Not
supposed
to
be
here.
Thank
you,
but
I'm
not.
And
I'll
tell
you
I
stand
before
you
in
this
arena
only
by
the
grace
of
Almighty
God.
In
watching
the
reports
over
the
last
few
days
many
people
say
it
was
a
providential
moment
probably
was.
When
I
rose
surrounded
by
Secret
Service,
the
crowd
was
confused
because
they
thought
I
was
dead.
And
there
was
great,
great
sorrow.
I
could
see
that
on
their
faces
as
I
looked
out.
They
didn't
know
I
was
looking
out.
They
thought
it
was
over.
But
I
could
see
it.
I
wanted
to
do
something
to
let
them
know
I
was
okay.
I
raised
my
right
arm,
looked
at
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
that
were
breathlessly
waiting
and
started
shouting
“Fight!
Fight!
Fight!”
Once
my
clenched
fist
went
up
and
it
was
high
into
the
air,
you've
all
seen
that,
the
crowd
realized
I
was
okay
and
roared
with
pride
for
our
country
like
no
crowd
I
have
ever
heard
before.
Never
heard
anything
like
it.
For
the
rest
of
my
life
I
will
be
grateful
for
the
love
shown
by
that
giant
audience
of
patriots
that
stood
bravely
on
that
fateful
evening
in
Pennsylvania.
Tragically,
the
shooter
claimed
the
life
of
one
of
our
fellow
Americans
Corey
Comperatore.
Unbelievable
person,
everybody
tells
me.
Unbelievable.
And
seriously
wounded
two
other
great
warriors.
Spoke
to
them
today.
David
Dutch
and
James
Copenhaver.
Two
great
people.
I
also
spoke
to
all
three
families
of
these
tremendous
people.
Our
love
and
prayers
are
with
them,
and
always
will
be
we're
never
going
to
forget
them.
They
came
for
a
great
rally.
They
were
serious
Trumpsters
I
want
to
tell
you.
They
were
serious
Trumpsters
and
still
are.
But
Corey,
unfortunately
we
have
to
use
the
past
tense.
He
was
incredible.
He
was
a
highly
respected
former
fire
chief
respected
by
everybody.
Was
accompanied
by
his
wife
Helen,
incredible
woman
I
spoke
to
her
today
devastated
and
two
precious
daughters.
He
lost
his
life
selflessly
acting
as
a
human
shield
to
protect
them
from
flying
bullets.
He
went
right
over
the
top
of
them
and
was
hit.
What
a
fine
man
he
was.
I
want
to
thank
the
fire
department
and
the
family
for
sending
his
helmet,
his
outfit.
And
it
was
just
something
they're
going
to
do
something
very
special
when
they
get
it
but
we
did
something
which
cannot
match
what
happened,
not
even
close,
but
I
am
very
proud
to
say
that
over
the
past
few
days
we've
raised
$6.3
million
for
the
families
of
David,
James
and
Corey,
including
from
a
friend
of
mine
just
called
up
he
sent
me
a
check
right
here.
I
just
got
it.
$1
million
from
Daniel.
And
thank
you,
Dan.
And
again,
when
speaking
to
the
family,
I
told
them
I
said
“Well,
we're
gonna
be
sending
you
a
lot
of
money
but
it
can't
compensate.”
They
all
said
the
same
thing.
“You're
right,
sir.
We
appreciate
so
much
what
you're
doing
but
nothing
can
take
the
place
in
the
case
of
Corey.”
And
the
other
two
by
the
way,
they
were
very,
very
seriously
injured
but
now
they're
doing
very
well.
They're
going
to
be
okay.
They're
going
to
be
doing
very
well.
They’re
warriors.
So
now,
I
ask
that
we
observe
a
moment
of
silence
in
honor
of
our
friend
Corey.
There
is
no
greater
love
than
to
lay
down
one's
life
for
others.
This
is
the
spirit
that
forged
America
in
our
darkest
hours,
and
this
is
the
love
that
will
lead
America
back
to
the
summit
of
human
achievement
and
greatness.
This
is
what
we
need.
Despite
such
a
heinous
attack,
we
unite
this
evening
more
determined
than
ever,
I
am
more
determined
than
ever
and
so
are
you,
so
is
everybody
else.
Thank
you
very
much.
Our
resolve
is
unbroken
and
our
purpose
is
unchanged
to
deliver
a
government
that
serves
the
American
people
better
than
ever
before.
Nothing
will
stop
me
in
this
vision
because
our
vision
is
righteous
and
our
cause
is
pure.
No
matter
what
obstacle
comes
our
way,
we
will
not
break,
we
will
not
bend,
we
will
not
back
down.
And
I
will
never
stop
fighting
for
you,
your
family
and
our
magnificent
country.
And
everything
I
have
to
give
with
all
of
the
energy
and
fight
in
my
heart,
and
so
I
pledge
to
our
nation
tonight.
Thank
you
very
much,
I
pledge
that
to
our
nation,
and
to
turn
our
nation
around
and
we're
going
to
do
it
very
quickly.
Thank
you.
This
election
should
be
about
the
issues
facing
our
country
and
how
to
make
America
successful,
safe
and
free
and
great
again.
In
an
age
when
our
politics
too
often
divide
us,
now
is
the
time
to
remember
that
we
are
all
fellow
citizens.
We
are
one
nation
under
God
indivisible,
with
liberty
and
justice
for
all.
And
we
must
not
criminalize
dissent
or
demonize
political
disagreement,
which
is
what's
been
happening
in
our
country
lately
at
a
level
that
nobody
has
ever
seen
before.
In
that
spirit,
the
Democrat
Party
should
immediately
stop
weaponizing
the
justice
system
and
labeling
their
political
opponent
as
an
enemy
of
democracy.
Especially
since
that
is
not
true.
In
fact,
I
am
the
one
saving
democracy
for
the
people
of
our
country.
I
have
very
big
news
as
you
probably
just
read.
On
Monday,
a
major
ruling
was
handed
down
from
a
highly
respected
federal
judge
in
Florida,
Aileen
Cannon,
finding
that
the
prosecutor
and
the
fake
documents
case
against
me
were
totally
unconstitutional
and
the
entire
case
was
thrown
out
of
court.
With
all
of
that
publicity,
thrown
out
of
court.
If
Democrats
want
to
unify
our
country,
they
should
drop
these
partisan
witch
hunts
which
I
have
been
going
through
for
approximately
eight
years,
and
they
should
do
that
without
delay
and
allow
an
election
to
proceed
that
is
worthy
of
our
people.
We're
going
to
win
it
anyway.
Worthy
of
our
people.
On
this
journey,
I
am
deeply
honored
to
be
joined
by
my
amazing
wife
Melania.
And
Melania,
thank
you
very
much.
You
also
did
something
really
beautiful,
a
letter
to
America
Calling
for
national
unity
and
it
really
took
the
Republican
Party
by
surprise.
I
will
tell
you
it
was
beautiful.
In
fact
some
very
serious
people
said
that
we
should
take
that
letter
and
put
it
as
part
of
the
Republican
platform.
That
would
be
an
honor
wouldn’t
it?
Right,
Mr.
Congressman?
But
it
captivated
so
many.
So
I
also
want
to
thank
my
entire
family
for
being
here.
Don,
Kimberly,
Ivanka
and
Jared,
Eric
and
Lara,
Tiffany
and
Michael,
Barron.
Barron,
we
love
our
Barron.
And
of
course,
my
10
wonderful
grandchildren.
You
saw
a
few
of
them
up
there
on
my
lap
before.
And
how
good
was
Dana?
Was
Dana
good?
Wasn’t
he
good?
You
know,
he
was
on
probably
the
only
vacation
he's
had
in
about
maybe
ever,
because
he
works
but
about
10
years
with
his
wife
very
far
away.
I
won't
tell
you
where
but
very
very
far
away.
Beautiful
place.
And
my
people
called
and
he
said,
“Yeah,
I
won't
be
able
to
do
it.
This
is
many,
many
years.
I
promised
my
wife
I
can't
do
it.”
And
they
came
and
they
said
“Dana
won't
be
able
to
do
it.”
Because
he
was
my
first,
second
and
third
choice.
I
said,
“Well,
you
know,
that's
too
bad,
but
I
understand
he's
away
and
it's
good.
It's
good
for
him.”
And
I
was
at
about
30
minutes
later,
she
came
back
in
sir,
Dana
just
called,
he's
going
to
do
it.
And
his
wife,
she
said
“You
can't
turn
him
down.
You
just
can't
do
it.
You
have
to
go.”
That's
a
good
wife.
So
he
got
on
a
plane.
He
got
here
a
little
while
ago.
Now
he's
gonna
get
on
the
plane
in
a
little
while
and
he's
gonna
go
back
home
to
his
wife.
But
they're
great
and
I
just
want
to
thank
her
and
him
and
their
whole
family
because
that's
not
easy.
And
Kid
Rock,
same
thing.
Called
he
said,
“I
want
to
be
a
part
of
it.”
I
want
to
be
a
part,
because
you
know
kid
does
this
great
song,
big,
big
monster
song.
I
had
no
idea.
He
became
a
friend
of
mine
over
the
last
10
years.
And
he's
amazing.
Everyone
loves
him.
I
didn't
even
know
how
big
he
was.
You
know,
he
has
rallies
35,000,
40,000
people
he
gets
every
time
he
goes
out.
I
think
he's
making
so
much
money
he
doesn't
know
what
the
hell
to
do
with
it.
And
then
we
have
my
other
friend
and
I've
known
him
so
long
and
we
took
that
song
and
it
was
a
big
success,
but
we
made
that.
I
saw
a
chart
of
great
songs
to
America.
That
was
number
one
on
the
chart
recently.
Number
one.
So
that’s
Lee
Greenwood.
Very
special,
beautiful
person.
He's
a
beautiful
man.
But
they
all
wanted
to
be
here.
They
called,
and
how
about
the
Hulkster?
How
good
was
he?
Where
is
he?
Boy
oh
boy.
You
know,
they
may
call
it,
they
may
call
that
entertainment.
I
know
about
entertainment,
but
when
he
used
to
lift
a
350
pound
man
over
his
shoulders
and
then
bench
press
him
two
rows
into
the
audience.
I
say
it
may
be
entertainment
but
he
is
one
strong
son
of
a
gun,
I
will
tell
you.
I
watched
it
many
times.
There
aren’t
a
lot
of
entertainers
that
can
do
that,
right?
You
are
fantastic.
Thank
you
very
much.
Followed
by
Eric.
What
was
that
all
about?
Boy,
that
was
good.
I
didn't
want
to
really
come
up
here.
But
he
was
so
great.
And
he's
such
a
good
young
man.
He
went
through
a
lot
of
trouble
and
Don
last
night
was
incredible.
They
went
through
so
much
trouble.
They
got
subpoenaed
more
than
any
people
probably
in
the
history
of
the
United
States.
Every
week
they
get
another
subpoena
from
the
Democrats
crazy
Nancy
Pelosi,
the
whole
thing
just
boom,
boom,
boom.
They've
got
to
stop
that
because
they're
destroying
our
country.
We
have
to
work
on
making
America
great
again,
not
on
beating
people.
And
we
won.
We
beat
them
at
all.
We
beat
them
on
the
impeachments.
We
beat
them
on
indictments.
We
beat
them,
but
the
time
that
you
have
to
spend,
the
time
that
you
have
to
spend.
If
they
were
to
devote
that
genius
to
helping
our
country,
we'd
have
a
much
stronger
and
better
country.
And
Jason,
the
biggest
star
in
country
music
Jason,
thank
you
for
being
here.
Jason,
thank
you
very
much.
Jason
Aldean.
He’s
good.
I
like
his
I
like
his
wife
even
better
by
the
way.
She's
here.
Thank
you,
Jason.
But
I'm
thrilled
to
have
a
new
friend
and
partner
fighting
by
my
side.
The
next
Vice
President
of
the
United
States,
the
current
senator
from
Ohio,
JD
Vance
and
his
incredible
wife
Usha.
He's
going
to
be
a
great
Vice
President.
He's
going
to
be
great.
He’ll
be
with
this
country
and
with
this
movement,
greatest
movement
in
the
history
of
our
country
–
Make
America
Great
Again.
When
they
criticize
it,
they
said
“We're
gonna
try
and
stop
MAGA.”
I
said,
“MAGA
is
making
America
great
again.
What
are
you
going
to
stop?
There's
nothing
to
stop.”
Then
they
say
“Oh,
that's
right.
It's
very
tough
to
fight
it.”
And
all
of
the
people
that
did
try
and
fight
it
have
failed,
but
he's
going
to
be
with
us
for
a
long
time
and
it
was
an
honor
to
select
him.
Great,
great
student
at
Yale.
His
wife
was
a
great
student
at
Yale.
They
met
at
Yale.
These
are
two
smart
people.
So
JD,
you're
going
to
be
doing
this
for
a
long
time.
Enjoy
the
ride.
And
a
very
special
thank
you
to
the
extraordinary
people
of
Milwaukee
and
the
great
state
of
...
oh
there
they
are.
There
they
are.
You
are
so
easy
to
spot.
And
Green
Bay
is
gonna
have
a
good
team
this
year.
Right?
They're
gonna
have
a
good
team.
They're
gonna
have
a
good
team.
Most
of
the
audience
doesn’t
like
it
but
it's
true.
You're
gonna
have
a
very
good
team.
And
by
the
way,
Wisconsin,
we
are
spending
over
$250
million
here
creating
jobs
and
other
economic
development
all
over
the
place.
So
I
hope
you
will
remember
this
in
November
and
give
us
your
vote.
I
am
trying
to
buy
your
vote.
I'll
be
honest
about
that.
And
I
promise
we
will
make
Wisconsin
great
again.
We're
gonna
make
...
Thank
you,
Mr.
governor.
Thank
you
very
much.
Thank
you.
I'm
here
tonight
to
lay
out
a
vision
for
the
whole
nation.
To
every
citizen,
whether
you're
a
young
or
old
man
or
woman,
Democrat,
Republican
or
independent,
Black
or
white,
Asian
or
Hispanic,
I
extend
to
you
a
hand
of
loyalty
and
of
friendship.
Together
we
will
lead
America
to
new
heights
of
greatness
like
the
world
has
never
seen
before.
We
were
right
there
in
the
first
term.
We
got
hit
with
COVID.
We
did
a
great
job.
Nobody
knew
what
it
was
but
nobody's
ever
seen
an
economy
pre
COVID,
and
then
we
handed
over
a
stock
market
that
was
substantially
higher
than
just
prior
to
COVID
coming
in,
did
a
great
job.
Never
got
credit
for
that.
We
got
credit
for
the
war
and
defeating
ISIS
and
so
many
things,
the
great
economy,
the
biggest
tax
cuts
ever,
the
biggest
regulation
cuts
ever,
the
creation
of
Space
Force,
the
rebuilding
of
our
military.
We
did
so
much.
We
did
so
much.
Right
to
try.
Right
to
try
is
a
big
deal.
We
got
right
to
try.
They
were
trying
to
get
that
for
52
years.
Somebody's
terminally
ill
and
hopefully
there's
nobody
in
this
audience,
but
it
does
happen
a
lot.
They’re
terminally
ill
and
they
can't
use
our
new
space
age,
drugs
and
other
things
that
we
are
way
ahead.
We
have
the
greatest
doctors
in
the
world,
the
greatest
laboratories
in
the
world
and
you
can't
do
it.
They've
been
trying
to
get
that
approved
for
52
years.
Wasn’t
that
easy.
The
insurance
companies
didn't
want
to
do
it.
They
didn't
want
the
risk.
The
labs
didn't
want
to
do
it
because
if
it
didn't
work,
people
are
pretty
far
down
the
line
for
death.
They
didn't
want
to
do
it.
The
doctors
didn't
want
to
have
it
on
their
record.
So
I
got
everybody
into
our
office.
52
years
they
tried.
Sounds
simple,
but
it's
not.
And
I
got
them
to
agree
that
somebody
that
needs
it
will
instead
of
going
to
Asia
or
Europe
or
someplace
or
if
you
have
no
money
going
home
and
dying.
Just
dying.
We
got
them
to
sign
an
agreement.
Agree
to
it
where
they're
not
going
to
sue
anybody.
They're
gonna
get
all
of
this
stuff.
They're
gonna
get
it
really
fast.
And
what's
happened
is
we're
saving
thousands
and
thousands
of
lives.
It's
incredible.
Right
to
try.
This
great
feeling.
Under
our
leadership,
the
United
States
will
be
respected
again.
No
nation
will
question
our
power,
no
enemy
will
doubt
our
might,
our
borders
will
be
totally
secure,
our
economy
will
soar.
We
will
return
law
and
order
to
our
streets,
patriotism
to
our
schools
and
importantly,
we
will
restore
peace,
stability
and
harmony
all
throughout
the
world.
But
to
achieve
this
future,
we
must
first
rescue
our
nation
from
failed
and
even
incompetent
leadership.
We
have
totally
incompetent
leadership.
This
will
be
the
most
important
election
in
the
history
of
our
country.
Under
the
current
administration,
we
are
indeed
a
nation
in
decline.
We
have
an
inflation
crisis
that
is
making
life
unaffordable,
ravaging
the
incomes
of
working
and
low
income
families
and
crushing,
just
simply
crushing
our
people
like
never
before.
They've
never
seen
anything
like
it.
We
also
have
an
illegal
immigration
crisis
and
it's
taking
place
right
now
as
we
sit
here
in
this
beautiful
arena.
It’s
a
massive
invasion
at
our
southern
border
that
has
spread
misery,
crime,
poverty,
disease
and
destruction
to
communities
all
across
our
land.
Nobody's
ever
seen
anything
like
it.
Then
there
is
an
international
crisis
the
likes
of
which
the
world
has
seldom
been
part
of.
Nobody
can
believe
what's
happening.
Wars
now
raging
in
Europe
and
the
Middle
East.
A
growing
specter
of
conflict
hangs
over
Taiwan,
Korea,
the
Philippines
and
all
of
Asia.
And
our
planet
is
teetering
on
the
edge
of
World
War
III.
And
this
will
be
a
war
like
no
other
war
because
of
weaponry.
The
weapons
are
no
longer
army
tanks
going
back
and
forth
shooting
at
each
other.
These
weapons
are
obliteration.
It's
time
for
a
change.
This
administration
can't
come
close
to
solving
the
problems
we're
dealing
with.
Very
tough,
very
fierce
people;
they’re
fierce
people.
And
we
don't
have
fierce
people.
We
have
people
that
are
a
lot
less
than
fierce,
except
when
it
comes
to
cheating
on
elections
and
a
couple
of
other
things,
then
they’re
fierce.
Then
they’re
fierce.
